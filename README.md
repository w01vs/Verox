# Hello

This is my attempt at making a compiled programming language. It will compile directly to nasm assembly x86-64. It will run on Linux. To get to a working programming language faster, I will use the C runtime internally to handle things suchs as heap allocation and file IO.

Working on:

* Structs

Next on the list:

Functions

Struct-bound functions
